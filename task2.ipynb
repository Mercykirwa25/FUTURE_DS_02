    "# **Customer Retention & Churn Analysis (RavenStack SaaS Dataset)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze SaaS customer and subscription data to answer critical retention and churn questions that business teams rely on to drive revenue growth and sustainable customer engagement. Using the RavenStack dataset this analysis evaluates historical customer activity, subscription records, feature usage, support interactions, and churn events to understand patterns that influence customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing only on descriptive statistics, this project is guided by four key business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why are customers leaving the platform?  \n",
    "2. Which customer segments are most likely to churn?  \n",
    "3. How long do customers typically stay active?  \n",
    "4. What actions can improve customer retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes information on customer accounts, subscription plans, churn events, feature engagement, and support tickets. Initial review indicates variation across plan tiers, industries, and customer behavior, suggesting opportunities to optimize customer engagement, support processes, and product feature adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to transform raw customer and subscription data into actionable insights that can support product, growth, and retention decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Factors Influencing Customer Retention**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Churn Reasons**  \n",
    "Understanding why customers leave is critical for targeted retention strategies. Early exploration shows multiple churn drivers including pricing concerns, support dissatisfaction, and unmet product needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Segmentation**  \n",
    "Retention differs across plan tiers, industries, and countries. Segment-level analysis allows the business to identify high-risk cohorts and tailor interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tenure and Engagement**  \n",
    "Customer lifetime varies widely depending on subscription plan, feature usage, and engagement patterns. Measuring tenure and usage metrics is essential to forecast churn risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth Opportunity Areas**  \n",
    "By combining churn reasons, segment analysis, tenure, and engagement, the business can pinpoint actions to improve retention and increase lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Managers responsible for feature development and engagement.  \n",
    "- Growth & Retention Teams monitoring churn trends and retention campaigns.  \n",
    "- Customer Support Teams improving resolution times and satisfaction.  \n",
    "- Executive Leadership using insights to guide strategic decisions and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "SaaS businesses often lack a clear understanding of why customers churn and which segments are at the highest risk. Without this insight, retention initiatives may be misdirected, reducing overall revenue potential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to answer the key business questions around churn drivers, segment risk, customer lifetime, and engagement patterns using historical subscription and customer data to support informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the primary reasons customers leave the platform.  \n",
    "2. Analyze which customer segments are most likely to churn.  \n",
    "3. Measure how long customers stay active and engaged.  \n",
    "4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metrics of Success**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will be considered successful if:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each key business question is clearly answered using data and visual analysis.  \n",
    "- Insights are supported by accurate metrics such as churn rate, tenure, usage counts, and satisfaction scores.  \n",
    "- Recommendations are actionable and aligned with the analysis findings.  \n",
    "- Results are communicated clearly for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Data Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze customer retention and churn, this project uses the **RavenStack SaaS Dataset** obtained from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rivalytics/saas-subscription-and-churn-analytics-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com]. The dataset is synthetic but reflects real SaaS behavior, including accounts, subscriptions, feature usage, support tickets, and churn events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes five CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `accounts.csv` (500 records) – Customer account information including industry, plan, country, signup date, and churn flag.  \n",
    "- `subscriptions.csv` (5,000 records) – Subscription details including start/end dates, plan tier, seats, MRR/ARR, and churn status.  \n",
    "- `feature_usage.csv` (25,000 records) – Feature engagement data per subscription including usage counts, duration, and beta features.  \n",
    "- `support_tickets.csv` (2,000 records) – Customer support interactions including resolution time, priority, and satisfaction scores.  \n",
    "- `churn_events.csv` (600 records) – Churn instances including reasons, refunds, and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Number of records | Accounts: 500, Subscriptions: 5,000, Feature Usage: 25,000, Support Tickets: 2,000, Churn Events: 600 |\n",
    "| Data types | Dates, categorical (industry, plan, reason), numeric (usage counts, tenure, MRR, ARR), boolean (churn, trial) |\n",
    "| Missing values | Some feedback_text, satisfaction_score, end_date for active subscriptions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Feature Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `account_id`: Unique customer identifier  \n",
    "- `account_name`: Fictional company name  \n",

    "- `country`: Country code of the account  \n",
    "- `signup_date`: Customer creation date  \n",
    "- `plan_tier`: Basic, Pro, or Enterprise  \n",
    "- `seats`: Licensed user count  \n",
    "- `churn_flag`: Indicates if account churned  \n",
    "- `subscription_id`: Unique subscription record  \n",
    "- `start_date` / `end_date`: Subscription start and end dates  \n",
    "- `mrr_amount` / `arr_amount`: Monthly and annual recurring revenue  \n",
    "- `usage_count`, `usage_duration_secs`: Feature engagement metrics  \n",
    "- `ticket_id`, `resolution_time_hours`, `satisfaction_score`: Support metrics  \n",
    "- `churn_date`, `reason_code`, `feedback_text`: Churn event details  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Relevance**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is highly relevant for the churn analysis task because its features directly support the key business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why are customers leaving the platform?**; Analyzed using `churn_events.reason_code` and `feedback_text`.  \n",
    "- **Which customer segments are most likely to churn?**; Evaluated using `accounts.plan_tier`, `industry`, `country`, and `seats`.  \n",
    "- **How long do customers typically stay active?**; Measured using `subscriptions.start_date` and `subscriptions.end_date` to calculate tenure.  \n",
    "- **What actions can improve retention?**; Explored through `feature_usage` engagement metrics and `support_tickets` satisfaction/resolution metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset provides **comprehensive, customer-level, and subscription-level information** needed to perform retention and churn analysis. It supports segment analysis, lifetime calculation, engagement assessment, and actionable insight generation, making it well-suited for SaaS customer retention analysis."

    "- Customers who are still active stay much longer than churned ones.\n",

    "#### Churned customers (Churned = 1):\n",
    "- Churned customers leave quickly, with mean tenure around 2–3.5 months.\n",

    "- Maximum tenure for churned customers is under 21 months, much lower than active customers.\n",

    "Action: Implement regular engagement emails, product tips, and reminders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing Features (14.6%):\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: Collect feedback on most requested features; prioritize feature updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support issues (13.6%):\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: Improve customer support quality and response time; possibly add live chat or self-help resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Budget / Pricing (23.5% combined):\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: Offer tiered plans, discounts, or flexible payment schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitor switching (9.3%):\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: Conduct win-back campaigns, highlight unique value, and track competitor offerings.\n",

    "2. Focus on High-Risk Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "From churn rate by segment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plan tiers: Enterprise and Pro have slightly higher churn rates (~10%) than Basic (~8.6%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Industries: DevTools and Cybersecurity show higher churn (~10–10.8%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Countries: FR, AU, and UK have highest churn rates (~11–12%).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Small businesses: personalized onboarding and check-ins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High churn industries: targeted support, webinars, and product demos.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why Customers Are Leaving\n",
    "\n",
    "The top reasons for churn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Inactive / No feedback (28%): customers lose interest or forget about the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Missing features (15%) and support issues (14%): product limitations and poor support drive churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Budget & pricing concerns (23% combined) and switching to competitors (9%) also contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Many churned users provide little or no feedback, limiting insight into their experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which Segments Are Most at Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Plan tier: Enterprise and Pro accounts show higher churn (~10%) than Basic (~8.6%).\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Industry: DevTools and Cybersecurity customers have slightly higher churn (~10–11%).\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Region: Customers from FR, AU, and UK have the highest churn rates (~11–12%).\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Account size: Small accounts (1–5 seats) are more likely to churn (~11%).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customer Tenure Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Most churn happens within the first few months of subscription:\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Median tenure for churned customers is <2 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Longer-tenure accounts (>12 months) are much less likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Key Retention Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Early engagement: onboarding, tutorials, and check-ins during the first 1–3 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Address product gaps: prioritize missing features and fix support issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Flexible pricing & incentives: target small accounts and price-sensitive segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Segment-focused retention: high-risk industries and regions get specialized campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "(v) Continuous feedback loops: encourage feedback from both active and churned customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Churn is mostly early-stage and preventable. Companies that proactively engage new users, resolve support and feature gaps, and tailor retention strategies to high-risk segments can significantly reduce churn and improve lifetime value.**"
