# 📈 Customer Retention & Churn Analysis (RavenStack SaaS Dataset)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **RavenStack SaaS Dataset** from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rivalytics/saas-subscription-and-churn-analytics-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com] to provide insights into customer retention, churn patterns, subscription behavior, and engagement metrics. By combining **EDA in Python** with **interactive dashboards in Power BI**, the project helps SaaS businesses understand why customers leave, which segments are at risk, and how to improve retention.
